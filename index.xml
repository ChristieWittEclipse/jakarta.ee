      <description>Those of you following Jakarta EE probably know that the upcoming Jakarta EE 8 release will be functionally equivalent to Java EE 8. The reason for this is that we want to prove that the transfer from Oracle is complete and that we are able to produce the processes, specifications, test suites and a compatible implementation through the Eclipse Foundation.</description>

      <description>Apache Kafka is a community-distributed streaming platform that has three key capabilities: publish and subscribe to streams of records, store streams of records in a fault-tolerant durable way, and then process streams as they occur. Apache Kafka has several success cases in the Java world. This post will cover how to benefit from this powerful tool in the Jakarta EE/MicroProfile universe.</description>
